Dependencies and installation

- This lisa_emotiw repo
  lisa_emotiw should be mentionned in the PYTHONPATH

- libsvm, with the "python" module in the PYTHONPATH

- chi2, in the PYTHONPATH

- Theano, in the PYTHONPATH


Installation of PICASA
- Picasa 3 (3.9, I think)
- Mount \\cerveau\data as Z:\ (from windows explorer)
- Create Z:\sans-bkp\faces\picasa_process\ProcessingFolder (Do Not Touch)

Things to configure on first launch:
- In the options, select .png among file extensions to watch
- Configure folders: watch Z:\sans-bkp\faces\picasa_process\ProcessingFolder (Do Not Touch), and nothing else
- Put some images with faces in that directory
- Watch them import (close and reload picasa if needed)
- Click on "Personnes" ("people") in the left menu, then the "expand" button (top of the main panel)
- Click on the "export" button (bottom of the main panel)
- In the dialog, change the main folder to Z:\sans-bkp\faces\picasa_process, and use "Faces" as album name

Once this is done, you can remove Faces and "ProcessingFolder (Do Not Touch)" from Z:\sans-bkp\faces\picasa_process, and the script should work.


Build the script extracting bbox coordinates:
- cd scripts/mirzamom
- python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Compiling cuda-convnet:
- create a phony cuda SDK folder $PHONY_SDK, I used /u/lamblinp/emotiw_final/toto
- copy the following headers from Pylearn2/pylearn2/sandbox/cuda_convnet into $PHONY_SDK/includes:
    cutil_inline.h
    cutil.h
    cutil_inline_bankchecker.h
    cutil_inline_runtime.h
    cutil_inline_drvapi.h
    drvapi_error_string.h
    helper_string.h
- edit build.sh with:
    export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/cuda-5.5.22
    export CUDA_SDK_PATH=$PHONY_SDK
    export PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/lisa/os/epd-7.1.2/include/python2.7
    export NUMPY_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/lisa/os/epd-7.1.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy
- Run with:
    CPATH=$PHONY_SDK/include:$CPATH OMIT_CUTIL_LIB=1 sh build.sh
